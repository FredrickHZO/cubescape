# cubescape
A 3D cube run mini game made with Raylib library

**Features still missing**
- ~~Player movement~~
- ~~Follow camera~~
- ~~Endless terrain generation~~
- ~~Obstacle spawn~~
- ~~Collision detection~~ 
- ~~Player movement only inside terrain boundaries~~
- Points system
- ~~Lives system~~
- ~~End game when there are no more lives available~~

Collision detection is not perfect, for it to be working flawlessly perspective distortion should be taken into account when running checks.
It **may** be upgraded in the future, but for now it is somewhat working.

After all the basic features are implemented, this is what ***may*** be added
- Better graphics
- Start menu
- Random spawn of bonuses (maybe based on points)
- Multiplicators
- Leaderboard
- Better collisions system

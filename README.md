# cubescape
A 3D cube run mini game made with Raylib library

**Feature still missing**
- ~~Player movement~~
- ~~Follow camera~~
- ~~Endless terrain generation~~
- ~~Obstacle spawn~~
- ~~Collision detection~~
- ~~Player movement only inside terrain boundaries~~
- Points system
- ~~Lives system~~
- End game when there are no more lives available

Collision and boundaries detection can use a lot of more love, but they're somewhat working, they're not perfect by any means, but _for now_ they will do.

After all the basic features are implemented, this is what ***may*** be added
- Better graphics
- Start menu
- Random spawn of bonuses (maybe based on points)
- Multiplicators
- Leaderboard
